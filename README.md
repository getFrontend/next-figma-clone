It has some usefull features like live collaboration with cursor chat, comments, reactions, and drawing designs (shapes, image upload) on the canvas using fabric.js.

This project is realized thanks to the **JavaScript Mastery** 🚀 tutorial and masterclass from **Adrian Hajdin**.

In the course of the project it was possible to consolidate the skills of real practical tasks, work with code documentation.
