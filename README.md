# About

[FigMan](https://figman.vercel.app/) is a minimalist clone of Figma, designed to help you create beautiful user interfaces without the clutter. It has some usefull features like live collaboration with cursor chat, comments, reactions, and drawing designs (shapes, image upload) on the canvas using fabric.js.

This project is realized thanks to the **JavaScript Mastery** 🚀 tutorial and masterclass from **Adrian Hajdin**.

In the course of the project it was possible to consolidate the skills of real practical tasks, work with code documentation.
